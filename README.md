### What is to be

To-be utility software primarily for removal of single-colour backgrounds in basic image formats.
Seeks to make the background fully transparent, avoid graining on the border of the image, and retain gradients around these borders as semi-transparent. In time, this will be reimplemented and optimized, likely in C or C++.

### What is and be

A mess of unorganized functions, containing large amounts of uncommented, outcommented, deprecated and/or unused code. 
Some for editing/toying around with colours and colourswaps, some for detecting borders and gradients, some for making images maximally transparent yet replicatable by placing output in front of assumed original background colour. Further more, current implementation is done in Java, used for this project as a prototyping language, chosen for ease of use and syntactic portability to C/C++.
